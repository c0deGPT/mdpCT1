      <p class= "developing-description">image3: I found there was no need to use 'setInterval()' to achive the oscillation of two pendulums, so I changed the effect of 2rd graphic.</p>

      <p class= "developing-description">image4: I want to achieve the effect that some circles appear with the oscillation of the pendulum, and then they take a linear movement.</p>

      <p class= "developing-description">image6: the question is that I didn't put 'ballPosX += velXba ll PosY += velY' in the loop function 'for (let ball of ballGenerate){}'. </p>
