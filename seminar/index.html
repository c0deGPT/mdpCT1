    <h1>1st paragraph in Programming Design Systems</h1>
    <p>1. I believe that techniques, tools, and media should never confine the boundaries of graphic design. To convey content more effectively, even dynamic, time-based, or interactive methods can be adopted as viable approaches.</p>
    <p>2. For instance, writing algorithms that generate unique patterns or layouts based on user input or random numbers can make designs more distinctive and impactful, creating different visual experiences depending on the viewer's interactions.</p>

    <h1>3rd paragraph in Programming Design Systems</h1>
    <p>1. Just as type design has evolved from handcrafted letters to modern digital font tools, change and development are constant themes that designers must adapt to.</p>
    <p>2. Exploring diverse methods and combining physical and digital spaces can also provide us designers with new insights.</p>

    <h1>4th paragraph in Programming Design Systems</h1>
    <p>1. I agree with this point. Compared to traditional design and drawing methods, programming provides a more intuitive and rapid way to test variations in effects, especially those involving randomness.</p>
    <p>2. I think another manifestation of randomness is the occurrence of bugs, but this isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing; instead, it can be a source of inspiration. Compared to traditional design methods, programming feels less predictable and more prone to creating the unexpected and unique, which often leads to surprising and stunning results.</p>

    <h1>3rd paragraph in 1p of What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
    <p>1. Indeed, the focus of a prototype lies in its interactive features and purposes; I believe its essence is to test and explore.</p>

    <h1>2nd paragraph in 2p of What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
    <p>1. After all, a prototype is still a relatively rough version, and its readability is not as strong compared to the potential final product, which is something designers need to consider.</p>
    <p>2. Additionally, how to control the space and the scope of the audience is also a key focus.</p>
