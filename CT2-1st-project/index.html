As this technology sweeps through society, it is fundamentally reshaping social structures—marriage is no longer a prerequisite for childbirth, as reproduction no longer depends on traditional male-female unions. Individuals only need to extract their sperm or eggs, place them in a commercialized surrogacy device in advance, and nurture their child from an embryo to full development. Moreover, they can choose the timing of the embryo's growth, everything is highly controlled technically.

            What's next? 
            1. The program's failure gave rise to an embryo that sought to break out on its own, but this very act led to its demise；
            2. A customization and control app for embryos and children turns the traditional parent-child relationship into a virtual pet-like upbringing；
            3. A series of marketing and promotional campaigns surrounding this product.
